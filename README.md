Q1: How can we predict the risk of type 2 diabetes in adults in California?

Q2: Are there any events, including lifestyle practices, educational level, family history, or health behaviors that are associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes? 

âˆ™ [Shawna Tuli Abstract](https://github.com/shawnatuli/accenture-california-type-2-diabetes-predictive-analytics/blob/main/Accenture%20Abstract.pdf) 

"I had the pleasure of having Shawna as my mentor for my UCI Data Science Capstone Project. Shawna mentored me for three months and provided advice not only on the project, but also on my career and personal life. She connected me with other professionals in the workplace who provided additional feedback on my project. What impressed me the most about Shawna was how passionate she was to make me succeed. She spared time on her days off to meet with me when I came across an issue in the project and patiently taught me when I made mistakes. I highly recommend Shawna because of how passionate she is about her job and how eager she is to share her knowledge with others to make them succeed." - Brian Wang (UCI Data Science Graduate)

"Shawna was the point of contact for a project my team was working on in conjunction with Accenture. Initially, her role was to answer any questions we had and provide some management over the progress and timeline of the project. However, Shawna went above and beyond in her mentorship. With regards to the project, she always made herself available to provide constructive feedback or give advice on how to approach problems we encountered. Outside the scope of the project, Shawna actively supported me by offering guidance on my career and ultimately helped me find a career path that I was not aware of before, but one that I believe is the right fit for me. She was able to empathize and understand who I was in order to make this judgement and I appreciate all of her words of encouragement and advice." - Kelly Im (UCI Data Science Graduate)

"Shawna is doing amazing job in leading the Accenture relationship with UC Irvine. She is spearheading the entire effort around Capstone Program which spans across two quarters where student work on a problem that is assigned to them by Accenture in the area of Data and AI. As a lead of this program, Shawna worked on 1. defining a problem that is around social good 2. identified relevant data 3. developed deliverables and timeline 4. helping and transitioning students. In addition, she is doing exemplary job keeping open communication with executive sponsors, keeping complete command on deliverables, understanding and solving technical challenges along the way. I am super excited to see Shawna grow in this role and very thankful for all the hard work that she does for this effort." - Vishrut Chokshi (Accenture Los Angeles Senior Manager, Data Science Enablement & Delivery Lead)
